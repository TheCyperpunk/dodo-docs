#### What is Form W-8 BEN-E?

W-8 BEN-E forms are Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms that foreign businesses must file to verify their country of residence for tax purposes, certifying that they qualify for a lower rate of tax withholding.

#### How to Fill Out Form W-8 BEN-E

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Part I – Identification of Beneficial Owner">
**1. Name of Organization That is the Beneficial Owner**

This is your entity name.

**2. Country of Incorporation or Organization**

This is the country of residence (where the business is registered). For a corporation, it is the country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or governed.

**3. Chapter 3 Status**

In this section, the most commonly checked box is "Corporation". The majority of foreign entities that are doing business fall under "Corporation" or "Partnership" status. Other options include:

- Foreign government – Controlled Entity
- Foreign government – Integral Part
- Estate
- Simple trust (grantor and complex, too)
- Central Bank of Issue
- Tax-exempt organization
- Private foundation
- International organization
- Disregarded entity

For Private Limited company - check the Corporation box
For Limited Liability Partnership - check the Partnership box

**4. Chapter 4 Status (FATCA Status)**

For SaaS/Digital Products, the most common choice here is Active NFFE. This means the business is an Active Non-Financial Foreign Entity. If none of the other categories fit, Active NFFE is the best option.

**5. Permanent Residence Address**

This is your business's permanent resident address. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country's income tax.

**8-10. Tax Identification Information**

You may provide the FTIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 9b for purposes of claiming treaty benefits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Part XXV – Active NFFE">
In this part of the form, you simply need to check box 39 to certify that:

- The entity in Part I is a foreign entity that is not a bank or financial institution.
- Less than 50% of the gross income for the preceding calendar year is passive income.
- Less than 50% of assets held are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (calculated as a weighted average of the % of quarterly passive assets).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Part XXX – Certification">
The most important part of the document is the certification and signature. Here, in writing, there needs to be a first name, last name, and date (on which the form was signed). The person signing the W-8BEN-E form must be authorized to sign for the beneficial owner.
