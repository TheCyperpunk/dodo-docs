## Prerequisites  

To integrate the Dodo Payments API, you'll need:  
- A Dodo Payments merchant account  
- API credentials (API key and webhook secret key) from the dashboard  

For a more detailed guide on the prerequisites, check this [section](/developer-resources/integration-guide#dashboard-setup).  

## API Integration  

### Checkout Sessions  

Use Checkout Sessions to sell subscription products with a secure, hosted checkout. Pass your subscription product in `product_cart` and redirect customers to the returned `checkout_url`.

<Warning>
You cannot mix subscription products with one-time products in the same checkout session.
</Warning>

### API Response  

The following is an example of the response:  

```json  
{
  "session_id": "cks_Gi6KGJ2zFJo9rq9Ukifwa",
  "checkout_url": "https://test.checkout.dodopayments.com/session/cks_Gi6KGJ2zFJo9rq9Ukifwa"
}
```  

Redirect the customer to `checkout_url`.  


### Webhooks

When integrating subscriptions, you'll receive webhooks to track the subscription lifecycle. These webhooks help you manage subscription states and payment scenarios effectively.

To set up your webhook endpoint, please follow our [Detailed Integration Guide](/developer-resources/integration-guide#implementing-webhooks).

#### Subscription Event Types

The following webhook events track subscription status changes:

1. **`subscription.active`** - Subscription is successfully activated.
2. **`subscription.on_hold`** - Subscription is put on hold due to failed renewal.
3. **`subscription.failed`** - Subscription creation failed during mandate creation.
4. **`subscription.renewed`** - Subscription is renewed for the next billing period.

For reliable subscription lifecycle management, we recommend tracking these subscription events.

#### Payment Scenarios

**Successful Payment Flow**

When a payment succeeds, you'll receive the following webhooks:


1. `subscription.active` - Indicates subscription activation
2. `payment.succeeded` - Confirms the initial payment:
    - For immediate billing (0 trial days): Expect within 2-10 minutes
    - For trial days: whenever that ends
3. `subscription.renewed` - Indicates payment deduction and renewal for next cycle. (Basically, whenever payment gets deducted for subscription products, you will get `subscription.renewed` webhook along with `payment.succeeded`)

**Payment Failure Scenarios**

1. Subscription Failure
  - `subscription.failed` - Subscription creation failed due to failure to create a mandate.
  - `payment.failed` - Indicates failed payment.

<Info>**Best Practice**: To simplify implementation, we recommend primarily tracking subscription events for managing the subscription lifecycle.</Info>

### Sample Subscription event payload

---

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `business_id` | string | Yes | The unique identifier for the business |
| `timestamp` | string | Yes | The timestamp of when the event occurred (not necessarily the same as when it was delivered) |
| `type` | string | Yes | The type of event. See [Event Types](#event-types) |
| `data` | object | Yes | The main data payload. See [Data Object](#data-object) |

## Changing Subscription Plans

You can upgrade or downgrade a subscription plan using the change plan API endpoint. This allows you to modify the subscription's product, quantity, and handle proration.

<Card title="Change Plan API Reference" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/api-reference/subscriptions/change-plan">
  For detailed information about changing subscription plans, please refer to our Change Plan API documentation.
</Card>

### Proration Options

When changing subscription plans, you have two options for handling the immediate charge:

#### 1. `prorated_immediately`
- Calculates the prorated amount based on the remaining time in the current billing cycle
- Charges the customer only for the difference between the old and new plan
- During a trial period, this will immediately switch the user to the new plan, charging the customer right away

#### 2. `full_immediately`
- Charges the customer the full subscription amount for the new plan
- Ignores any remaining time or credits from the previous plan
- Useful when you want to reset the billing cycle or charge the full amount regardless of proration

#### 3. `difference_immediately`
- When upgrading, the customer is immediately charged the difference between the two plan amounts.
- For example, if the current plan is 30 Dollars and the customer upgrades to an 80 Dollars, they are charged $50 instantly. 
- When downgrading, the unused amount from the current plan is added as internal credit and automatically applied to future subscription renewals.
- For example, if the current plan is 50 Dollars and the customer switches to a 20 Dollars plan, the remaining $30 is credited and used toward the next billing cycle.

### Behavior

- When you invoke this API, Dodo Payments immediately initiates a charge based on your selected proration option
- If the plan change is a downgrade and you use `prorated_immediately`, credits will be automatically calculated and added to the subscription's credit balance. These credits are specific to that subscription and will only be used to offset future recurring payments of the same subscription
- The `full_immediately` option bypasses credit calculations and charges the complete new plan amount

<Tip>
**Choose your proration option carefully**: Use `prorated_immediately` for fair billing that accounts for unused time, or `full_immediately` when you want to charge the complete new plan amount regardless of the current billing cycle.
</Tip>

### Charge Processing

- The immediate charge initiated upon plan change usually completes processing in less than 2 minutes
- If this immediate charge fails for any reason, the subscription is automatically placed on hold until the issue is resolved

## On-Demand Subscriptions

<Info>
  On-demand subscriptions let you charge customers flexibly, not just on a fixed schedule. Contact support to enable this feature.
</Info>

**To create an on-demand subscription:**

To create an on-demand subscription, use the [POST /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions) API endpoint and include the `on_demand` field in your request body. This allows you to authorize a payment method without an immediate charge, or set a custom initial price.

**To charge an on-demand subscription:**

For subsequent charges, use the [POST /subscriptions/charge](/api-reference/subscriptions/create-charge) endpoint and specify the amount to charge the customer for that transaction.
