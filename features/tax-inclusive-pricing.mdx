## What Is Tax Inclusive Pricing?

Tax Inclusive Pricing lets you embed applicable taxes directly in your displayed product price. Customers see one final amount upfront for a more transparent, conversion‑friendly experience. At checkout, Dodo calculates the tax‑exclusive portion and tax amount from the displayed price based on customer location, and clearly breaks them out on the invoice.

<Info>
Final tax still varies by customer location and tax category. Checkout and invoices show the calculated tax portion derived from the displayed price.
</Info>

## Key Benefits

- **Clarity for customers**: One final price displayed upfront
- **Compliance by region**: Tax is calculated per location and broken out
- **Accurate invoicing**: Invoices show net amount and tax derived from price
- **Conversion friendly**: Reduced surprises at checkout

## Product Setup

Create or edit a product in your dashboard, then enable tax‑inclusive pricing under pricing settings.

#### Pricing

- **Price** (required): Base price that is displayed to the customer.
- **Tax Inclusive Pricing**: Toggle on to treat the displayed price as tax inclusive. Dodo will compute the net (pre‑tax) amount and tax portion at checkout based on customer location and tax category.

<Warning>
Only future purchases reflect updated tax‑inclusive settings. Existing purchases and active subscriptions are not retroactively changed.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use consistent product copy such as “Tax inclusive” so customers understand totals at a glance.

## Integration Examples

### Create a product with tax‑inclusive pricing
```typescript
const product = await client.products.create({
  name: 'Pro Plan',
  description: 'All features included',
  price: {
    currency: 'USD',
    price: 10000
    tax_inclusive: true
  }
});
```

### Update an existing product to toggle tax inclusive
```typescript
await client.products.update(product.id, {
  price: {
    tax_inclusive: true
  }
});
```



## Best Practices
