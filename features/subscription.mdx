## What Are Subscriptions?

Subscriptions are recurring products customers purchase on a schedule. They’re ideal for:

- **SaaS licenses**: Apps, APIs, or platform access
- **Memberships**: Communities, programs, or clubs
- **Digital content**: Courses, media, or premium content
- **Support plans**: SLAs, success packages, or maintenance


## Key Benefits

- **Predictable revenue**: Recurring billing with automated renewals
- **Flexible cycles**: Monthly, annual, custom intervals, and trials
- **Plan agility**: Proration for upgrades and downgrades
- **Add‑ons and seats**: Attach optional, quantifiable upgrades
- **Seamless checkout**: Hosted checkout and customer portal
- **Developer-first**: Clear APIs for creation, changes, and usage tracking

## Creating Subscriptions

Create subscription products in your Dodo Payments dashboard, then sell them through checkout or your API. Separating products from active subscriptions lets you version pricing, attach add‑ons, and track performance independently.

### Subscription Configuration

Configure each subscription product with:

- **Recurring price** and currency
- **Billing cycle** (monthly, yearly, or custom)
- **Free trial** or introductory pricing
- **Add‑on availability** and quantity rules
- **Tax category** and compliance settings

## Common Use Cases

- **SaaS and APIs**: Tiered access with add‑ons for seats or usage
- **Content and media**: Monthly access with introductory trials
- **B2B support plans**: Annual contracts with premium support add‑ons
- **Tools and plugins**: License keys and versioned releases

## Integration Examples

### Checkout Sessions (subscriptions)
When creating checkout sessions, include your subscription product and optional add‑ons:

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    {
      product_id: 'prod_subscription',
      quantity: 1
    }
  ]
});
```


### Plan changes with proration
Upgrade or downgrade a subscription and control proration behavior:

```typescript
await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
  product_id: 'prod_new',
  quantity: 1,
  proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately'
});
```

### Cancel at period end
Schedule a cancellation without immediate termination of access:

```typescript
await client.subscriptions.update('sub_123', {
  cancel_at_period_end: true
});
```

### On‑demand subscriptions
Create an on‑demand subscription and charge later as needed:

```typescript
const onDemand = await client.subscriptions.create({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  product_id: 'prod_on_demand',
  on_demand: true
});

await client.subscriptions.createCharge(onDemand.id, {
  amount: 4900,
  currency: 'USD',
  description: 'Extra usage for September'
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Start with clear tiers**: 2–3 plans with obvious differences
- **Communicate pricing**: Show totals, proration, and next renewal
- **Use trials thoughtfully**: Convert with onboarding, not just time
- **Leverage add‑ons**: Keep base plans simple and upsell extras
- **Test changes**: Validate plan changes and proration in test mode
