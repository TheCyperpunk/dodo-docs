</AccordionGroup>


## Configuring Payment Methods

While all payment methods are automatically available based on customer location and currency, you can optionally restrict which payment options appear during checkout using the `allowed_payment_method_types` parameter.

### When to Configure Payment Methods

You may want to configure allowed payment methods to:

- Control which payment options appear to customers based on your business requirements
- Restrict payment methods for specific product types or transaction flows
- Maintain consistency across different payment experiences
- Optimize checkout experience for your target audience

### Implementation

<Steps>
<Step title="Add parameter to API request">
Include the `allowed_payment_method_types` field in your payment or subscription creation request:

```json
{
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit",
    "apple_pay"
  ]
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Test the configuration">
Verify that only the specified payment methods appear at checkout.

<Tip>
Test payment method availability with different customer locations and currencies to ensure the configuration works as expected.
</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### API Endpoints

This configuration is supported by the following endpoints:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Create Checkout Session" icon="cart-shopping" href="/api-reference/checkout-sessions/create">
    Create checkout sessions with allowed payment methods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Payment" icon="credit-card" href="/api-reference/payments/post-payments">
    One-time payments with allowed methods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Subscription" icon="repeat" href="/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions">
    Subscription payments with recurring methods.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Implementation Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="One-Time Payment">
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit",
    "apple_pay",
    "google_pay"
  ]
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Subscription">
```json
{
  "product_id": "prod_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_456",
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit"
  ]
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Regional Focus">
```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "eur",
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit",
    "ideal",
    "bancontact",
    "sepa"
  ]
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Default behavior">
If `allowed_payment_method_types` is not specified, all eligible payment methods will be available based on customer location, currency, and transaction type. Only use this parameter when you need to restrict payment methods.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regional considerations">
Consider your target market when selecting payment methods. Including region-specific options (like UPI for India or iDEAL for Netherlands) can significantly improve conversion rates in those markets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor and optimize">
Track which payment methods your customers use most frequently and adjust your allowed methods based on actual usage patterns and conversion data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Important Considerations

Payment method availability depends on multiple factors:
- **Customer Location**: Some payment methods are region-specific
- **Merchant Settings**: Your account configuration and capabilities
- **Currency**: Supported payment methods vary by currency
- **Transaction Type**: Some methods don't support subscriptions or have minimum amounts

<Note>
Adding a payment method to `allowed_payment_method_types` doesn't guarantee it will appear - it must also be eligible based on these factors.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Payment method not appearing at checkout">
**Possible causes:**
- The payment method is not included in `allowed_payment_method_types`
- The payment method is not supported for the customer's location
- The payment method doesn't support the transaction currency
- For subscriptions: the payment method doesn't support recurring payments
- The transaction amount is below the minimum threshold (e.g., BNPL methods)

**Solution:** Verify all eligibility requirements are met and check your API request configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected payment methods appearing">
**Possible causes:**
- The `allowed_payment_method_types` parameter is not being passed correctly
- There may be conflicting configurations in your merchant dashboard

**Solution:** Review your API request payload and ensure the parameter is properly formatted as an array of strings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regional payment method not available">
**Possible causes:**
- The customer's location doesn't match the payment method's supported region
- The currency is not supported by the regional payment method
- Your merchant account may not be enabled for that specific payment method

**Solution:** Verify regional and currency compatibility, and contact support if you believe the method should be available.
