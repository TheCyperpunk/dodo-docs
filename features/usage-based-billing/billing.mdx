Billing connects your meters and events to product pricing so customers are charged for what they use each billing cycle. You link a meter to a product, set a price per unit, and optionally a free threshold.

## Billing Configuration

Each usage‑billed product should specify:

<ParamField path="Product Type" type="string" required>
Set this to <strong>Usage‑Based</strong> when creating or editing the product.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Associated Meter" type="string" required>
Choose the meter that aggregates your events for this product.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Price Per Unit" type="number" required>
Amount charged for each unit measured by the associated meter.

<Info>
Example: If price per unit is `$0.50` and a customer consumes 1,000 units, they are charged `$500.00`.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Free Threshold" type="number">
Optional number of units included at no charge each billing cycle before paid usage applies.

<Info>
Example: With a free threshold of `100`, price per unit `$0.50`, and usage `250` units, the billable units are `150` and the charge is `$75.00`.
</Info>
</ParamField>

<Note>
You can link up to 10 meters per product to track multiple dimensions (e.g., API calls, storage, compute time).
</Note>


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No charges are appearing">
- Ensure the product <strong>Product Type</strong> is set to <strong>Usage‑Based</strong>.
- Verify the <strong>Associated Meter</strong> exists and matches the `event_name` you send.
- Check that events arrive within the current billing period.
- Confirm price per unit is configured and not zero.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Totals look incorrect">
- Make sure the meter’s aggregation matches your intent (Count vs Sum).
- If using filters or an <em>Over Property</em>, include the required metadata in events.
- Re‑check free threshold math: billable units are `max(usage - free_threshold, 0)`.
- Validate currency/rounding rules in your pricing display.
