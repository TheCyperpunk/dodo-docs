Usage-based billing lets you charge customers for what they actually use—API calls, storage, AI tokens, or any metric you define. Customers pay for consumption, not fixed fees.

<Info>
**Perfect for**: APIs, AI services, infrastructure platforms, and any product where value scales with usage.
</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Send Usage Events">
Your application sends events when billable actions occur.

```javascript
{
  "event_id": "evt_123",
  "customer_id": "cus_abc",
  "event_name": "api.call",
  "metadata": { "endpoint": "/v1/users" }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Meters Aggregate Usage">
Meters aggregate events into billable quantities using Count, Sum, Max, or Last aggregation.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Billing">
Set pricing per unit and free thresholds. Customers are billed automatically each cycle.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Core Concepts

### Events

Events represent usage actions in your application. Each event includes:
- **Event Name**: Type of usage (e.g., `api.call`)
- **Customer ID**: Who used it
- **Metadata**: Additional properties for aggregation

### Meters

Meters aggregate events into billable quantities:
- **Count**: Total events (API calls)
- **Sum**: Add values (total bytes)
- **Max**: Highest value (peak users)
- **Last**: Most recent value

### Products with Usage Pricing

Set pricing per unit and optional free thresholds:

**Example**: 2,500 calls - 1,000 free = 1,500 × $0.02 = $30.00

### Customer Credits

Give customers included usage credits that refresh each billing cycle. Credits apply before paid usage.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Meter">
In your dashboard: **Meters** → **Create Meter**

1. Set event name (e.g., `api.call`)
2. Choose aggregation (Count, Sum, Max, Last)
3. Add optional filters
</Step>

<Step title="Add to Product">
Link meter to a product with pricing:

<Frame>

</Frame>

1. Select **Usage-Based Billing**
2. Choose your meter
3. Set price per unit and free threshold
</Step>

<Step title="Send Events">
```javascript
await fetch('https://test.dodopayments.com/events/ingest', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.DODO_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    events: [{
      event_id: "unique_event_id",
      customer_id: "cus_abc123",
      event_name: "api.call",
      metadata: { endpoint: "/v1/users" }
    }]
  })
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Usage">

Check your meter's dashboard to see events and usage aggregation. Customers are billed automatically each cycle.
