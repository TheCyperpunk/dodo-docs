Usage‑based billing lets you charge customers for what they actually use. It’s ideal for APIs, infrastructure, and products where value correlates with consumption.

## What Is Usage Based Billing?

You meter actions in your product (events), aggregate them into measurable quantities (meters), and convert those quantities into charges (billing rules) on a schedule.

## Key Benefits

- **Pay for actual value**: Align price with consumption.
- **Flexible models**: Count, sum, max, or last-value aggregation.
- **Targeted metering**: Filter events to include only what matters.
- **Transparent invoices**: Itemized usage, prices, and units.

## Core Components
