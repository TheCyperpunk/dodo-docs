## What Are One‑Time Payments?

One‑time payments are fixed, up‑front purchases—ideal for:

- **Software licenses**: Lifetime or major‑version unlocks
- **Digital downloads**: E‑books, templates, graphics, or plugins
- **Services**: Audits, onboarding packages, or one‑off consulting
- **Events and tickets**: Courses, workshops, or live sessions

## Key Benefits

- **Simple checkout**: No renewals or proration logic
- **Instant fulfillment**: Deliver licenses or files right away
- **Flexible pricing**: Discounts and taxes supported
- **Developer‑first**: Clear APIs for creation, refunds, and webhooks

## Creating One‑Time Products

Create products in your Dodo Payments dashboard, then sell them via hosted checkout, payment links, or your API.

### Product configuration

Configure the fields in the dashboard to define how your product appears and sells.

#### Product details

- **Product Name** (required): Display name shown in checkout and invoices
- **Product Description** (required): Clear value statement customers see before paying
- **Product Image** (required): PNG/JPG/WebP up to 3 MB
- **Brand**: Associate the product with a specific brand for theming and emails
- **Tax Category** (required): Choose the correct category to determine tax rules

<Tip>
Pick the most accurate tax category to ensure correct tax collection per region.
</Tip>

#### Pricing

- **Pricing Type**: Choose <b>Single Payment</b>
- **Price** (required): Fixed charge with currency
- **Discount Applicable (%)**: Optional percentage discount displayed in checkout and invoices

<Warning>
Changing product pricing affects only new purchases. Existing customers aren’t impacted.
</Warning>

#### Advanced settings

- **Tax Inclusive Pricing**: Display prices inclusive of applicable taxes
- **Generate license keys**: Issue a unique key after purchase. See <a href="/features/license-keys">License Keys</a>
- **Digital Product Delivery**: Deliver files or content automatically. See <a href="/features/digital-product-delivery">Digital Product Delivery</a>
- **Metadata**: Attach custom key–value pairs for internal tagging or integrations. See <a href="/api-reference/metadata">Metadata</a>

<Tip>
Use metadata to store identifiers from your system (e.g., orderId) to reconcile events and receipts later.
</Tip>

## Integration Examples

### Checkout Sessions (single payment)
Create a checkout session with a one‑time product in the cart:

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    { product_id: 'prod_one_time', quantity: 1 }
  ]
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Clarify deliverables**: Tell buyers exactly what they get and how it’s delivered
- **Deliver instantly**: Use license keys or digital delivery for immediate access
- **Track with metadata**: Store your IDs for easy reconciliation
