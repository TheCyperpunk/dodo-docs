## What Are Discount Codes?

Discount codes are promotional tokens that reduce order totals at checkout. They’re ideal for:

- **Seasonal campaigns**: Black Friday, product launches, or anniversaries
- **Acquisition offers**: First‑purchase incentives or referral rewards
- **Retention**: Win‑back or loyalty rewards for existing customers
- **B2B deals**: Contracted or negotiated pricing via private codes

## Key Benefits

- **Flexible discounts**: Percentage or fixed amount off
- **Targeted control**: Restrict by product and subscription cycles
- **Campaign governance**: Expiration dates and usage limits
- **Seamless checkout**: UI field and API support via checkout sessions

## Creating Discount Codes

Create discount codes in your Dodo Payments dashboard, then apply them in hosted checkout or via API.

### Dashboard setup

- **Discount Name** (required): Internal and dashboard display name
- **Code** (required): The string customers enter at checkout
- **Type & Amount** (required): Set a percentage or fixed‑amount value, or generate a random code using the button provided
- **Expiration Date** (optional): Date after which the code becomes invalid
- **Usage Limit** (optional): Max total redemptions across all customers
- **Product Restriction** (optional): Limit applicability to selected products
- **Subscription Cycle Limit** (optional): Number of billing cycles the discount applies to

<Tip>
Use cycle limits for introductory pricing on subscriptions (e.g., "50% off for 3 months").
</Tip>

## Checkout Experience

1. Shoppers enter the code in the checkout field.
2. Eligible discounts are applied and totals update immediately.

<Info>
In Checkout Sessions, pass `discount_code` to pre‑apply a code, and set `feature_flags.allow_discount_code` to show the input field.

## Common Use Cases

- **Intro offers**: Limited‑time launch promotions for new products
- **Bulk or B2B**: Contracted discounts for select product sets
- **Retention plays**: Win‑back codes in churn‑prevention workflows
- **Seasonal campaigns**: Holiday or event‑based promotions

## Integration Examples

### Apply a discount in Checkout Sessions
Pre‑apply a discount and show the code input UI.

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    { product_id: 'prod_abc', quantity: 1 }
  ],
  discount_code: 'BLACKFRIDAY2024',
  customer: { email: 'user@example.com', name: 'Jane Doe' },
  return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/return'
});
```

### Enable discount entry without pre‑applying
Let customers enter a code at checkout without passing one upfront.

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    { product_id: 'prod_abc', quantity: 1 }
  ],
  feature_flags: {
    allow_discount_code: true
  },
  return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/return'
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Name clearly**: Use recognizable codes that match campaign names
- **Time‑box**: Add expirations to drive urgency and prevent misuse
- **Scope wisely**: Limit to specific products to avoid margin leakage
- **Validate early**: Check code applicability before confirming checkout
- **Monitor impact**: Track usage and conversion by campaign

<Info>
Discount codes are powerful levers for acquisition and retention. Start with simple, well‑named offers, validate thoroughly, and iterate based on performance.
