```

### Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Mobile App to Dodo API">
The process begins with the mobile app creating a payment link by interacting with the Dodo API.
</Step>

<Step title="Dodo API to Mobile App">
The Dodo API responds by providing a checkout URL back to the mobile app.
</Step>

<Step title="Mobile App to Checkout Page">
The mobile app then opens this checkout URL within a WebView, leading the user to the checkout page.
</Step>

<Step title="Checkout Page to Your Server">
Upon completion of the checkout process, the checkout page communicates with your server through redirects or webhooks.
</Step>

<Step title="Your Server to Mobile App">
Finally, your server grants access to the purchased content or service, completing the transaction cycle back in the mobile app.
</Step>
</Steps>
