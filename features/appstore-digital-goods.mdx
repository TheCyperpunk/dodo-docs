  A[Mobile App] -->|Create Payment Link| B(Dodo API)
  B -->|Checkout URL| A
  A -->|Open in WebView| C[Checkout Page]
  C -->|Redirects / Webhooks| D[Your Server]
  D -->|Grant Access| A
```

1. **Mobile App to Dodo API**: The process begins with the mobile app creating a payment link by interacting with the Dodo API.
2. **Dodo API to Mobile App**: The Dodo API responds by providing a checkout URL back to the mobile app.
3. **Mobile App to Checkout Page**: The mobile app then opens this checkout URL within a WebView, leading the user to the checkout page.
4. **Checkout Page to Your Server**: Upon completion of the checkout process, the checkout page communicates with your server through redirects or webhooks.
5. **Your Server to Mobile App**: Finally, your server grants access to the purchased content or service, completing the transaction cycle back in the mobile app.

## Regional Availability

Dodo Payments enables alternative in-app purchase flows only in App Store regions where Apple explicitly allows external payments, or where a regulator or court order mandates it. As of now, these regions include:

- **United States**: Supported to the extent permitted by current court orders and Apple’s updated guidelines.
- **European Union (EU) App Store**: Supported via Apple’s EU Alternative Terms and External Purchase Entitlement.
- **South Korea**: Supported through the StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement for Korea-only binaries.

<Warning>
Always review and comply with Apple’s region-specific entitlements and App Store Connect requirements before enabling Dodo Payments for any storefront. Using alternative payment flows in unsupported regions may result in app rejection or removal.
</Warning>

<Note>
For some business models - such as services or certain categories of content - Apple may not require the use of in-app purchase (IAP) at all. Dodo Payments supports these models as well. Always verify your app’s classification and Apple’s latest guidelines to determine if IAP is mandatory for your use case.
