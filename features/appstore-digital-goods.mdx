## Introduction

Dodo Payments empowers developers to sell digital goods and services in iOS apps, handling complex aspects like tax compliance, currency conversion, and payouts. This comprehensive guide details how to integrate Dodo Payments into your iOS app, specifically for SaaS tools, content subscriptions, and digital utilities.

## Regional Availability

Dodo Payments supports alternative in-app purchase flows only in App Store storefronts where Apple explicitly permits external payments or where a binding regulator/court order requires it. As of this publication, those jurisdictions include EU App Store storefronts (via Apple’s EU Alternative Terms / External Purchase Entitlement), South Korea (StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement for Korea-only binaries), and the U.S. App Store to the extent allowed by current court orders and Apple’s corresponding guideline updates. Dodo is a global replacement for Apple IAP in the regions which are entitled and claimed to be under jurisdiction of Applie IAP usage, always follow Apple’s region-specific entitlements and App Store Connect requirements before enabling Dodo for a given storefront.

  A[Mobile App] -->|Create Payment Link| B(Dodo API)
  B -->|Checkout URL| A
  A -->|Open in WebView| C[Checkout Page]
  C -->|Redirects / Webhooks| D[Your Server]
  D -->|Grant Access| A
```

1. **Mobile App to Dodo API**: The process begins with the mobile app creating a payment link by interacting with the Dodo API.
2. **Dodo API to Mobile App**: The Dodo API responds by providing a checkout URL back to the mobile app.
3. **Mobile App to Checkout Page**: The mobile app then opens this checkout URL within a WebView, leading the user to the checkout page.
4. **Checkout Page to Your Server**: Upon completion of the checkout process, the checkout page communicates with your server through redirects or webhooks.
5. **Your Server to Mobile App**: Finally, your server grants access to the purchased content or service, completing the transaction cycle back in the mobile app.
