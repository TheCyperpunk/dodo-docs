Add-ons are additional products that can be attached to your main subscription products, enabling flexible pricing models and enhanced customer experiences. Whether you need seat-based billing, feature upgrades, or custom pricing structures, add-ons give you the power to create sophisticated subscription offerings.

## What Are Add-ons?

Add-ons are supplementary products that customers can purchase alongside their main subscription. They're perfect for:

- **Seat-based billing**: Additional team members, user licenses, or concurrent users
- **Feature upgrades**: Premium features, advanced analytics, or priority support
- **Usage extensions**: Extra storage, API calls, or bandwidth allowances
- **Service add-ons**: Professional services, training, or consultation hours

## Key Benefits

- **Flexible Pricing Models**: Offer base plans with optional add-ons to create sophisticated pricing structures. You can address diverse customer segments with upgrades that grow as your customers' needs change.
- **Revenue Optimization**: Boost your average revenue per user (ARPU) by presenting relevant add-ons. This enables natural upsell opportunities as customers add features over time.
- **Simplified Management**: Manage all pricing components from one dashboard. Add-ons are automatically included in both checkout sessions and subscription management.
- **Customer Choice**: Allow customers to customize their subscriptions by selecting only the add-ons they need, which enhances satisfaction and reduces churn.

## Creating Add-ons

Add-ons are created as separate products in your Dodo Payments dashboard and then attached to your main subscription products. This separation allows you to:

- Reuse add-ons across multiple subscription products
- Manage pricing independently
- Track add-on performance separately
- Update add-ons without affecting base subscriptions

### Add-on Configuration

When creating add-ons, you can configure:

- **Pricing**: Set one-time or recurring pricing for the add-on
- **Billing cycle**: Match your subscription billing or use different cycles
- **Quantity limits**: Set minimum and maximum quantities per customer
- **Availability**: Control which subscription products can use the add-on
- **Tax settings**: Configure appropriate tax categories

## Common Use Cases

- **Seat-Based Billing**: Additional team members, user licenses, or concurrent users
- **Feature Upgrades**: Premium features, advanced analytics, or priority support  
- **Usage Extensions**: Extra storage, API calls, or bandwidth allowances
- **Service Add-ons**: Professional services, training, or consultation hours

## Integration Examples

### Checkout Sessions with Add-ons
When creating checkout sessions, you can include add-ons with custom quantities:

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    {
      product_id: 'your_subscription_id',
      quantity: 1,
      addons: [
        {
          addon_id: 'your_addon_id',
          quantity: 3 // 3 additional seats
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  // ... other checkout options
});
```

### Plan Changes with Add-ons
Modify existing subscriptions to add, remove, or update add-ons:

```typescript
// Add add-ons to existing subscription
await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
  product_id: 'prod_new',
  quantity: 1,
  proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately',
  addons: [
    { addon_id: 'addon_123', quantity: 2 }
  ]
});

// Remove all existing add-ons
await client.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_123', {
  product_id: 'prod_new',
  quantity: 1,
  proration_billing_mode: 'difference_immediately',
  addons: [] // Empty array removes all existing add-ons
});
```

### Dynamic Pricing
Calculate total costs dynamically based on add-on selections:

```typescript
function calculateTotalCost(basePrice: number, addons: AddonSelection[]) {
  const addonTotal = addons.reduce((sum, addon) => 
    sum + (addon.price * addon.quantity), 0
  );
  return basePrice + addonTotal;
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Launch with 2-3 core add-ons and expand options based on customer feedback and usage.
- **Maintain pricing clarity**: Clearly communicate add-on pricing and value, so customers understand what they're getting for the extra cost.
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate add-on combinations to ensure pricing calculations remain accurate and checkout flows function smoothly.

### Design Considerations

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Each add-on should have a clear benefit that customers can easily understand
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related add-ons together in your checkout flow
- **Flexible Quantities**: Allow customers to adjust quantities of add-ons as needed
- **Transparent Pricing**: Show total costs clearly throughout the checkout process

<Info>
Add-ons are a powerful way to create flexible, scalable pricing models that grow with your customers. Start with simple use cases and expand as you learn what works best for your business and customers.
