**Pay What You Want (PWYW)** lets customers decide how much they pay—at or above a merchant‑defined minimum. It increases engagement, encourages community support, and provides flexible pricing for digital products.

## What Is Pay What You Want?

PWYW is a pricing model where customers set their own price within guardrails you define. It’s ideal for:

- **Digital products and media**: Templates, e‑books, courses, plugins
- **Experimental launches**: Early access, beta releases, time‑boxed promos
- **Bundles and extras**: Add a PWYW tier to boost participation

## Key Benefits

- **Customer‑driven pricing**: Buyers choose what they pay
- **Revenue floor**: Enforce a minimum to protect margins
- **Anchored expectations**: Optional suggested price to guide choices
- **Seamless checkout**: Hosted checkout and receipts handled for you
- **Developer‑first**: Clear APIs for creation, refunds, and webhooks

<Warning>
PWYW is available only for **Single Payment** (one‑time) products.
</Warning>

## Creating Pay What You Want

Create a one‑time product and enable PWYW in your Dodo Payments dashboard. The sections below map directly to the creation form.

### Product creation

#### Product details

- **Product Name** (required): Display name shown in checkout and invoices
- **Product Description** (required): Clear value statement customers see before paying
- **Product Image** (required): PNG/JPG/WebP up to 3 MB
- **Brand**: Associate the product with a specific brand for theming and emails
- **Tax Category** (required): Choose the correct category to determine tax rules

<Tip>
Pick the most accurate tax category to ensure correct tax collection per region.
</Tip>

#### Pricing

- **Pricing Type**: Choose <b>Single Payment</b>
- **Pay What You Want** (toggle): Enable to let buyers choose the amount
- **Minimum Price** (required): Lowest allowed amount a customer can pay
- **Suggested Price** (optional): Recommended amount shown on the product page

<Tip>
Use metadata to store identifiers from your system (e.g., orderId) so you can reconcile events and receipts later.
</Tip>

## Common Use Cases

- **Digital assets**: Themes, templates, icon sets, media, or plugins
- **Content and education**: E‑books, courses, workshops with supporter pricing
- **Community & donations**: Fundraisers, open‑source sponsorships, creator support
- **Launch experiments**: Beta access and time‑boxed campaigns to gauge demand

## Integration Examples

### Checkout Sessions (single payment, PWYW)
Add a PWYW product to the cart. Checkout collects the buyer’s amount (respecting your minimum) — no extra fields are required.

```typescript
const session = await client.checkoutSessions.create({
  product_cart: [
    { product_id: 'prod_pwyw_demo', quantity: 1 }
  ],
  return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/checkout/success'
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Choose a sensible minimum**: Cover costs while keeping participation easy
- **Use a suggested price**: Anchor expectations to improve average order value
- **Explain value clearly**: Tell buyers what their contribution unlocks
- **A/B test campaigns**: Time‑box offers and experiment with messaging
- **Monitor distribution**: Track paid amounts to refine minimum and suggested price

<Info>
PWYW is a flexible way to invite more customers in while preserving a revenue floor. Start simple, test thoroughly, and iterate based on conversion, contribution distribution, and refund rates.
