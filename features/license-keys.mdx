## What Are License Keys?

License keys are unique tokens that authorize access to your product. They’re ideal for:

- **Software licensing**: Desktop apps, plugins, and CLIs
- **Per‑seat controls**: Limit activations per user or device
- **Digital goods**: Gate downloads, updates, or premium features

## Key Benefits

- **Access control**: Define expiry and activation limits
- **Operational visibility**: Track usage, devices, and history
- **Security and support**: Disable, re‑enable, and audit quickly

## Creating License Keys

Create license keys from your Dodo Payments dashboard. Configure how keys are issued and used.

### Configuration fields

- **License Key Expiry Date**
    - Defines how long a key remains valid. Use “no expiry” for perpetual keys.
    - Examples: 30 days, 1 year, or perpetual.

- **Activation Limit** 
    - Sets the maximum concurrent activations per key. Use “unlimited” to allow any number of activations.
    - Examples: 1 for single‑user, 5 for team license.

- **Activation Instructions**
    - Shown to customers and emailed with the license key so they can activate successfully.
    - Examples: “Paste the key in Settings → License” or “Run: mycli activate `<key>`”.

<Tip>
Use realistic instructions and include support links to reduce activation tickets.

## Integration Examples

### Activate a license

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
import DodoPayments from 'dodopayments';

const client = new DodoPayments({
  bearerToken: 'My Bearer Token',
});

const response = await client.licenses.activate({ license_key: 'license_key', name: 'name' });

console.log(response.id);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Validate a license

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
import DodoPayments from 'dodopayments';

const client = new DodoPayments({
  bearerToken: 'My Bearer Token',
});

const response = await client.licenses.validate({ license_key: '2b1f8e2d-c41e-4e8f-b2d3-d9fd61c38f43' });

console.log(response.valid);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

- **Keep limits clear**: Choose sensible defaults for expiry and activations.
- **Guide users**: Provide precise activation instructions and self‑serve docs.
- **Automate checks**: Validate keys server‑side before granting access.
- **Monitor events**: Use webhooks to detect abuse and automate revocations.
