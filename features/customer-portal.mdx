## What Is the Customer Portal?

The portal provides a trusted, branded self‑service experience for customers to:

- **Access billing history**: View invoices and download.
- **Manage subscriptions**: Cancel a subscription.
- **Retrieve license keys**: Access all keys tied to purchases

## Key Benefits

- **Lower support volume**: Customers resolve common billing requests on their own
- **Faster time‑to‑value**: Immediate access to invoices and keys
- **Reduced churn risk**: Clear visibility into renewals and plan details
- **Secure by design**: Tokenized access with expiring links

## Access Methods

Customers can reach the portal using either a static link or a one‑time dynamic link.

### Static link (email‑based access)

Customers can request portal access by entering their email at a static link that never expires. 

The static portal link format is:

```bash
https://test.customer.dodopayments.com/login/{business_id}
```
Replace `{business_id}` with your actual business identifier, then share this link with customers so they can enter their email and receive secure access to the portal.

## Integration Examples

Create a time‑bound Customer Portal session for a specific customer via API, then redirect the user to the session URL.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Node.js
const session = await client.customers.customerPortal.create('cus_123');

// Redirect the user to the hosted Customer Portal
window.location.href = session.link;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

- **Link expired**: Generate and send a new dynamic link.
- **Email not recognized**: Ask the customer to use the email associated with their purchase
