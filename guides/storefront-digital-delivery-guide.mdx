## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Products Bundle

To sell multiple digital products together:

1. Create a new product representing the bundle
2. Upload all files for the bundle (up to 10 files)
3. Set a bundle price
4. Add the bundle to your storefront

<Tip>
Bundles are great for offering value packages like "Complete Course + Workbook + Templates".
</Tip>

### Subscription-Based Digital Content

For recurring digital content delivery:

1. Create a subscription product
2. Configure digital delivery with the initial content
3. Update the product files periodically for new content
4. Subscribers maintain access to all versions

<Warning>
File updates only affect future purchases. Existing customers retain access to the version they purchased.
</Warning>

### Custom Return URLs

Configure custom return URLs for post-purchase redirects:

1. In your product settings, add a **Return URL**
2. Customers will be redirected here after successful payment
3. Use this to show custom thank-you pages or onboarding flows

## Best Practices

<Card title="File Security" icon="shield-halved">
For sensitive content, use external hosting with authentication rather than direct file uploads. Consider services that support expiring or signed URLs.
</Card>

<Card title="File Organization" icon="folder-tree">
Use clear, descriptive file names. For bundles, consider creating a ZIP file with organized folders for better customer experience.
</Card>

<Card title="Product Descriptions" icon="file-lines">
Write detailed descriptions explaining exactly what customers will receive. Include file formats, sizes, and any software requirements.
</Card>

<Card title="Visual Appeal" icon="image">
Use high-quality product images and a professional cover image for your storefront to build trust and increase conversions.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Important Considerations

### Security & Access Control

- **Static URLs**: Uploaded files use static download links that can be shared
- **No Revocation**: Issuing refunds doesn't revoke file access
- **Recommendation**: For licensed or sensitive content, use external services with DRM or authentication

### File Management

- **Update Impact**: Updating files only affects new purchases
- **Version Control**: Consider including version numbers in file names
- **File Limits**: Maximum 10 files per product, reasonable file sizes recommended

### Refund Policy

- **Access Retention**: Customers keep downloaded files even after refunds
- **Best Practice**: Clearly state your refund policy on product descriptions
- **Alternative**: Consider time-limited access via external hosting for refund scenarios

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Products not showing on storefront">
**Solution**: Ensure products are checked in the Storefront settings and the storefront is published. Check that you're viewing the correct mode (Test vs Live).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Download links not working">
**Solution**: Verify files were uploaded successfully in product settings. For external links, ensure the URL is publicly accessible and correctly formatted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Customers not receiving emails">
**Solution**: Check spam folders. Verify the customer email is correct. Ensure webhook configuration is set up properly for automated emails.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Files too large to upload">
**Solution**: Use external hosting (Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS S3) and provide the download link instead of uploading directly.
